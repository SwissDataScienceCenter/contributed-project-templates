# Contributed Renku project templates

This repository holds a collection of renkulab project templates developed and contributed by 
members of the renku community. They typically implement some specific functionality or interface
that is beyond what should be included in a default base template, but is interesting for a wider
audience. 

## Contributing

Do you find yourself often making the same changes to the configuration of your renku projects? 
Do you always need to install a base collection of packages specific to your domain? You may have
a good candidate for a template! Feel free to create a template and submit a PR to this repository
or open an issue with an idea if you're not quite sure how to do it yourself! We can have a look 
at your requirements together and figure out how to extract them into a template that can be used
by others. 

### How to add a new template

If you want to contribute a new template, you should take a look at the existing templates and think 
about what you want your project template to facilitate. Have a look at the [template documentation](https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/templates.html)
to see how the template should be structured and what kind of special information might be needed 
(e.g. in the [manifest.yaml file](https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/templates.html)).
